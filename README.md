# Mini Loan Application
 User Authentication: Implemented user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and cookies, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and utilize the loan application features.

Role-Based Access Control: Designed and implemented role-based access control (RBAC) to distinguish between regular users and administrators. Admins have the privilege to change loan status.

Redux State Management: Utilized Redux to efficiently manage and share application state across components, enhancing data flow and user experience.

Responsive UI Design: Employed Reactstrap, a popular UI library for React, to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface, enhancing user interaction and accessibility.

Loan Application Workflow: Developed a streamlined loan application workflow that guides users through the process of applying for loans, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Admin Functionality: Created an admin dashboard with the capability to view and manage loan applications, change loan statuses, and make informed decisions.

API Integration: Interfaced with backend APIs for handling user authentication, loan application submission, and admin functionalities, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

Deployment: Successfully deployed the application to a web server, making it accessible to users for testing and evaluation.
